OMG, just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Screamboat and WOW, my mind is like all over the place right now. It's like someone took Jaws and mashed it up with every horror flick ever, threw in a boat, and said “Let’s make a stew!” You know what I mean? Seriously, it was insane.

Like, don't even get me started on that captain guy. I mean, this dude was straight-up wild! Just yelling all the time in ways that made you wonder if he belonged on a soap opera instead of a creepy boat. Who even yells that much when there are mutant piranha things attacking?? 😂

And the part with the lifeboats sinking because they're full of holes — honestly! Do these people not check their gear before they head into killer water territory? Common sense out the window, right there. Ugh, makes you wonder if just 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 the   wasn't the best option.

> But wow, the creature design was lowkey cool though, not gonna lie. Those CGI piranhas looked more like disgruntled swimming potatoes with teeth, and it somehow worked. I was half expecting one to break out into a musical number halfway through. 😂 Like, imagine if they suddenly started singing Broadway-style to the terrified sailors!!

Sometimes it really feels like they make it up as they go along, y'know? One second it’s all chill, the next you've got water monsters going all City Smash Bros. on the boat like it’s a Tuesday afternoon. And the main character just randomly knows how to ... repair a ship's radio? Okay, sure! Just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 the   made my brain do a loop-de-loop.

uh, yeah… console.writeLine(“What was that even?”);

Anyway, overall I’m glad I 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 it. Can't say it didn’t keep me laughing — not sure that was the point but hey! Maybe next time I’ll pick something a little less… unhinged. Or maybe more. I dunno, depends on how much coffee I've had, I guess!
